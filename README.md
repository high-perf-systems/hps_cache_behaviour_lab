# hps_cache_behaviour_lab
Empirical Exploration of Cache Behaviour via Memory Access Pattern

Motivation : 
High performance systems like AI inference engines, robotics frameworks, databases , search engines fail or succeed on memory 
behaviour and not algorithms.
Modern CPUs are fast, memory systems are slow. Understanding caches becomes critical to build and maintain reliable high performance systems.

Core question of the project : 
How does memory layout affect performance and why?

This project is an attempt to answer the question above and in the process record data, code and benchmarking results.
